# Salary Prediction using Linear Regression

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple machine learning workflow to predict employee salaries based on key attributes such as experience, education, age, and company rating. The project uses Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn to create, train, and evaluate a Linear Regression model.

## Dataset
- Synthetic dataset generated in Python
- 100 samples
- Features:
  - Experience (years)
  - Education (years)
  - Age
  - Company Rating (1–5)
- Target:
  - Salary (integer values)

## Workflow
1. **Data Generation:** Create a synthetic dataset with noise to simulate real-world data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Check structure, data types, and summary statistics.
3. **Feature & Target Selection:** Separate independent variables (features) and dependent variable (Salary).
4. **Train-Test Split:** Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
5. **Model Training:** Train a Linear Regression model on the training set.
6. **Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using:
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - R² Score
7. **Prediction Comparison:** Compare predicted vs actual salaries.

## Skills & Tools
